                <p> Recently graduated with MS in Data Science with focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I am currently working in ITU Lahore as
                    teaching assistant and previously worked in a AI company based in Lahore called Auxtend. I have worked on several
                    machine learning projects including multi-label text classification, information retrial, neural machine translation, chat-bots,
                    semantic similarity for document relevance etc. I am proficient in data cleaning and preprocessing, computer vision and
                    natural language processing.I am fluent in python and comfortable working with both tensorflow and pytorch. Currently I
                    am working on MRNet competition by Stanford University to automate the diagnosis of ACL injury in knee using MRI
                    scans. I was able to design a neural network structure to incorporate all the three (sagittal, coronal, axial) views of the MRI
                    scan into a single neural network for a end to end machine learning solution with validation AUC accuracy of 94%.</p></td>
